# tic-tac-toe
Tic Tac Toe for The Odin Project

The code for this project is very MESSY. A lot of lessons were learned and re-learned during the making of this.
Upon review of the MINIMAX algorithm, it will be hard to integrate my code (again, the code for the game works but it is messy). It is better to start over but I'd rather move on further TOP's course.
